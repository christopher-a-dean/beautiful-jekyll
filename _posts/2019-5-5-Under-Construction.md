# This site is under construction
I am putting it together in between job interviews and work. 
I am currently working on a separate site [Jesse Dillon Construction](https://jdillon-contracting.github.io/).
Only these two sites are a fork of the beautiful-jekyll project. This is saving me some time but lacks the customization and personality I usually like in my sites.

My portfolio showcase still needs work so you will need to check my github work.
If you are looking for website work, application development, or considering me for a job opening, please email me and I can send you a sample of my work and schedule time to speak.

Email me at christopher@engineer4hire.com

P.S. if you like chess, I created the [OLGA Chess Viewer](http://www.chessgames.com/olgahelp.html) for chessgames.com

Thanks
