I am willing to do Applications and Websites at a negotiated flatrate. This requires several hours of analysis and a Bid to be generated for the job. I will commit to the Bid/Estimate I send you. If there is a work change order during the duration of the original Bid, a new estimate will be generated and agreed upon before I commit to the work change order.
